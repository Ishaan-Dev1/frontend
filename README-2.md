# �� Observability Stack

This repository manages the complete Observability (O11y) setup for Kubernetes, combining metrics, logging, and tracing into a cohesive system for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

---

## �� Introduction to Observability (O11y)

Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a system by examining its external outputs—primarily **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**. 

- **Metrics (Monitoring)**: Numeric representation of data measured over intervals of time.
  <!-- > _Tells us **what** is happening._ -->

- **Logs (Logging)**: Textual records of events at a point in time.
  <!-- > _Explains **why** it is happening._ -->

- **Traces (Tracing)**: Show the full journey of a request across services.
  <!-- > _Illustrates **how** it is happening._ -->
